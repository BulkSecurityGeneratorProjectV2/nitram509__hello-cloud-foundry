 Hello World sample application for Cloud Foundry PAAS
=======================================================

To give a little context, here are some thoughts:
 * Using GeoIP Database from MaxMind
 * Using Java + Jersey in backend
 * Using AngualarJS in frontend

There is exactly one use case:
 * When pressing the resolve button, the country is resolved by using the clients IP adress.
 
This program is installed at:

##### [Update] Jul'13
 Since installing the demo instance on Clound Foundry in Nov'12,
 some unlovely events happened and forced me to withdraw the demo site.
